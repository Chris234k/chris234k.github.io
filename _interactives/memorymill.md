Built for the [Museum of Work and Culture](http://www.rihs.org/museums/museum-of-work-and-culture).

Each marker on the map represents a mill. Tapping on a mill will open a dialogue describing the mill in the active era. Users can browse through 5 eras (1800s, 1850s, 1900s, 1950s, 2000s) to see how the mill changed over time. There are 4 stations per computer, which allow 4 users to explore at once.

All content for markers are loaded from a server.
