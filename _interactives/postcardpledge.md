Objectives:
- Highlight an issue: we can all help the environment
- Sense of community: you are not alone

These objectives split the interactive into two separate applications: pledge and display.

### Pledge -- Highlighting the Issue
The user can select from 4 main categories: resources, food, travel, and trash.
<div class="aspectratio">

</div>
Each category contains 4 subcategories. For example, travel contains: carpooling, community bike paths, avoiding car idling, and vehicle emissions. Each subcategory comes with a description, giving the user more information about how to act on their pledge.

After the user has selected a category and a subcategory, they begin to create their postcard:
1. Add your name
2. Choose a background (select from various pictures of Antarctica)
3. Take a picture of yourself (using a webcam)
4. Email it (enter your email)

We then send the personalized postcard to the appropriate email address. This literally gives the user something to take home with them, a gentle reminder of their pledge to help the environment. We send the key aspects of their pledge, category and subcategory, over to the display applcation.

### Display -- Sense of Community

I was tasked with making the two applications communicate. The client, [Boston Productions](http://www.bostonproductions.com/), provided roughly the following objectives:
- See what other's have pledged
- Reset data on a regular or user controlled basis
- Communicate with numerous Pledge stations

Networking. Ports. Local server (for simplicity)
