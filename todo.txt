todo
try to order by precedence
-----

- support landscape thumbnails

- home button (link on my name?)

- create layout for  sections: interactives, jams / experimental / misc
-- should probably include traveling merchant in jams / experimental (due to unreleased)


- alternative to trailer link: landscape screenshot (at least for games)
