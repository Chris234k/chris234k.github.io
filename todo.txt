todo
try to order by precedence
-----

- create layout for sections: interactives, jams / experimental / misc
-- should probably include traveling merchant in jams / experimental (due to unreleased)

- add space between grid thumbnails (current ones expand so are clickable outside visuals)
- scale grid thumbnails down with screen (mobile looks eh) to reveal more of the image

- alternative to trailer link: landscape screenshot / gif (at least for games)

- DESIGN (removed slate stylesheet)
-- header & footer style (footer needs love: http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/keeping-footers-at-the-bottom-of-the-page bootstrap also has a 'sticky footer')
-- home button (name doesn't read as button)

- loop twitter embedded gif by default (see Galaxy Hook)
