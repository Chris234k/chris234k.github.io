- CLICK TO ENLARGE IMAGES (HOW DID I NOT THINK ABOUT THIS)
- should probably include traveling merchant in jams / experimental (due to unreleased)
- scale grid thumbnails down with screen (mobile looks eh) to reveal more of the image
- "demo-gif" class works for all images (see postcardpledge), consider rename
- home button (name doesn't read as button)
- loop twitter embedded gif by default
- Google analytics https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/
