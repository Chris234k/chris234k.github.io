todo
try to order by precedence
-----

- create layout for sections: interactives, jams / experimental / misc
-- should probably include traveling merchant in jams / experimental (due to unreleased)

- add space between grid thumbnails (current ones expand so are clickable outside visuals)

- alternative to trailer link: landscape screenshot (at least for games)

- DESIGN (removed slate stylesheet)
-- header & footer style (footer needs love)
-- home button (name doesn't read as button)
