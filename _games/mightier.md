## Remote Contract Work for [Mightier](https://mightier.com/)

Things were getting quite busy over at Neuromotion Labs and they needed some additional help bringing games onto their platform. Through [Petricore](https://petricoregames.com/), I worked for about 10 months on porting games to Mightier. Specifically, the games I worked on were:

- Air Hockey
- Race the Sun
- Runaway Toad
- Unpossible
- You Must Build a Boat
- And general bug fixes / minor support for a number of other games

You can see the full list of games available on Mightier [here](https://mightier.com/games). My role also involved a bit of tools and platform level development. There were a common set of steps for integrating each game, and I developed Unity Editor extensions as I went along. My involvment was some of the first remote contracting they preformed for game integration, so process development became a part of my role.

Side note: Two games that I worked on are actually on Mightier as well: [Hibachi Hero](/games/hibachihero) and [Gelato Flicker](/games/gelatoflicker). There was a particularly funny moment when the folks at Mightier asked me to fix a bug in Gelato Flicker :)
