## [Mightier](https://mightier.com/)

I worked with Mightier in 2017-2018 as a remote contractor and in December of 2019 I joined Mightier full time as a platform engineer!

I've worked on platform, tools, and a number of game integrations:
- Air Hockey
- Race the Sun
- Runaway Toad
- Unpossible
- You Must Build a Boat

Side note: two games that I personally developed are actually on Mightier as well: [Hibachi Hero](/games/hibachihero) and [Gelato Flicker](/games/gelatoflicker). There was a particularly funny moment when I was asked to fix a bug in Gelato Flicker :)
