## [Mightier](https://mightier.com/)
Mightier is a small team so I work in different parts of engineering regularly. Gameplay, UI, tools, performance; you name it. Our main project is an RPG designed to teach kids about principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Here are some samples.

## RPG 
Think Pokemon, but with cards. Sample shows a battle starting and playing a few attacks.

<br>

Hatch new creatures and grow your team

### Cutscenes
Sample cutscene, built on top of Unity's Timeline system.

Tool example: shows an NPC moving and delivering a few lines. The text system supports localization in 6 languages (including Right-To-Left for Arabic)

### Tools
A few of Mightier's internal tools

Scan the entire project for usages of any Unity prefab/scene/animation/etc. Sample shows tracking a script usage from prefabs into a scene.
Takes <1 second to scan nearly 6,000 files. This tool is very optimized and is some of my best work.
<div class="aspectratio">
<video controls muted loop src="/assets/images/mightier/tools/find-refs.mp4"></video>
</div>

<br>
<br>

Workflow tool to quickly swap between scenes. Includes organization by internal categories.
<div class="aspectratio">
<video controls muted loop src="/assets/images/mightier/tools/scene-switch.mp4"></video>
</div>

<br>
<br>

Avatar customization system. Sample shows a creation of a new outfit. Worked closely with the artist to setup naming conventions and Avatar parts in a way that makes this easy for us.
<div class="aspectratio">
<video controls muted loop src="/assets/images/mightier/tools/avatar-create.mp4"></video>
</div>

<br>
<br>

Avatar outfit tester. Avoids having to launch the game to make small outfit edits.
