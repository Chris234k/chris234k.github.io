## [Mightier](https://mightier.com/)
Mightier is a small team so I work in different parts of engineering regularly. Gameplay, tools, performance; you name it. Our main project is an RPG designed to teach kids about principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Here are some samples.

## RPG 
Think Pokemon, but with cards. Sample shows a battle starting and playing a few attacks.
