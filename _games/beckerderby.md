## Release QA for [Maximum Crash](https://rejontaylor.com)

My good friend Rejon Taylor-Foster (aka Maximum Crash) needed a bit of help with QA on his latest and greatest mobile baseball game just before release. Becker Derby is the 3rd installment in his Starlot Derby series, which is an endless baseball series featuring a number of minigames and a wild overarching narrative. You can find a bit more about the game on the [Maximum Archives](https://archive.maximumcrash.com/becker-derby/), where he keeps all the information about his work.

My Role:
- Bug reporting (repro steps, video recordings)
- Discussing various fixes and recommending quality of life changes
- General QA and simple regression testing
