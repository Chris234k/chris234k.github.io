## [Petricore](http://petricoregames.com/)'s Fourth Game

A big departure from Petricore's previous 3 games [Mind The Arrow](/games/mindthearrow), [Gelato Flicker](/games/gelatoflicker), and [Battery Boy](/games/batteryboy)-- Dogfight is targeting console and PC. The concept spawned from, you guessed it, the pun "dog fight". What started out as a joke quickly became an idea we saw some real potential in. Not many arcade style airplane games have been released in recent years. It is a bit of a callback to games like Starfox, that one minigame in Sly Cooper 2, or even Pilot Wings. The gameplay features wacky dog-themed weapons, dogs, cute dogs, and also dogs. More information can be found about the game [here](http://dogfight.petricoregames.com/).

My Role:
- Early flight control prototypes
- Reticle lock on + aim adjust
- Plane tricks / turn around maneuvers
- Art pipeline tools (prefab swapper, scene switcher)
