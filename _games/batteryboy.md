## [Petricore](http://petricoregames.com/)'s Third Game
[NEEDS QA]
Publishing deal had ended with our previous partner. Maybe half way through development, we set out to work with another publisher. One of us met with [iDreamSky](http://www.idreamsky.com/en) at GDC, and the rest is history. iDreamSky only has publishing interests in China, so we thought it could be a cool opportunity to localize our work and reach a new market.

We've been through quite a few iterations. Let me take you on a small journey through Battery Boy's development.



### Rhythmic Roots
At it's conception, and through a lot of it's development, we thought Battery Boy would be a rhythm game with a cool twist: battery life.

[EXPLANATION OF RHYTHM]
If this description isn't clear, or maybe just doesn't sound that great, don't worry. Most people just weren't getting it, and with a closer look, we weren't really either. In the back of all our minds was the thought to remove rhythm entirely.



### Crazy Currencies
A little unsure what to do with rhythm, we explored other ways of using the battery life mechanic. We spoke with some of the local game developers at the Indie Game Collective, or [IGC](http://www.indiegamecollective.org/). They echoed our concerns about having rhythm. They didn't understand how it fit into the game either. One of the developers proposed tying the battery life mechanic to the currency collection. He suggested to tier battery life (low, medium, high) and only be able to get certain types of currency at current tiers. This idea stuck. Mobile games commonly have at least 2 types of currency anyway: premium and in-game currency. Premium costs real money or ads to obtain. While "in-game" can come in many forms [FIRE EMBLEM] [ANIMAL CROSSING].

This led us to something closer to a material crafting system. Which is how I'd classify both of those games [BOTH IMPLIES ABOVE GAMES]. Having something sufficiently interesting to replace it, it's at this point that we felt confident enough to ditch rhythm.



### Something About Identity (I'm out of alliterations)
We tried to repurpose old ideas and create new ones around the core twist: device battery life changes the game. We settled on two primary implementations:
1. Gameplay is harder at lower battery
2. Currency can only be obtained at certain battery tiers

Our previous games, [Mind the Arrow](/games/mindthearrow/) and [Gelato Flicker](/games/gelatoflicker/), lacked complexity within monetization. We wanted to try something more robust.

### A Tiny Postmortem
- Battery Boy stands as a solid and varied take on the endless runner genre. Which is increasingly more difficult to do, given the saturation of the genre.
- I wish we'd gone further with the "currencies as materials" concept. The current system strikes me as an awkward halfway point that comes with more confusion than either extreme.
- Difficulty increasing with lower battery is too subtle. I worry many players don't notice it. Doesn't mean the game needs to be harder, just that the visual effect should be more pronounced.
- Being able to connect to Facebook and get rewarded for beating your friends scores is seriously cool. Worth exploring in other games. Works especially well because you run past your friends' high scores, might be difficult to implement in more abstract scoring games.
- We're at least partially guilty of the [second-system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) on the shop. Just because we could build a shop doesn't mean we should have. Basically, time would have been better spent making the battery life more pronounced.
