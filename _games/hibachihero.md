## [MassDiGI](https://www.massdigi.org) SIP 2015

MassDiGI brings college students from all around the U.S. (and Ireland!) together to create games from scratch. The Summer Innovation Program (SIP) lasts for approximately 10 weeks. At the end of the summer, we presented Hibachi Hero to a publisher, [Thumbspire](https://www.thumbspire.com/), who ultimately handled the iOS launch in the semester following SIP.

My Role:
- Lead programmer (on a team of 3)
