## [Becker College 24hr Jam](https://itch.io/jam/beckerigda24)

Hopefully, by now, you understand the name is a joke. Created at one of Becker College's yearly game jams. Theme of the jam was "Experiment".

My Role:
- Obstacle programming (lazer walls, debris field, ring)
- Ship programming (turrets)
