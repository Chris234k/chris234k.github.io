## [Global Game Jam 2018](https://globalgamejam.org/theme-2018)

A large game jam that takes place annually. The theme for 2018 was "transmission". With a team of 2, both of which are programmers, we set out to create something small.

"Who Put That Cactus There" features 4 core mechanics around the ball:
1. Throw
2. Retract
3. Swap places
4. Interact remotely

The current version is more of a mechanical exploration than a game. There are a few scenarios built for each mechanic, showcasing what we think it might play like as a finished product.

For example, this segment is likely the most difficult portion of the game:
<div class="aspectratio">
<img src="/assets/images/whoputthatcactusthere/mechanics.gif" class="demo-gif">
</div>
3 of 4 mechanics are at play here, in quick succession. The ball cannot be thrown unless it is retracted, and subsequently held by the player. This mandates additional complexity that I am not sure is valuable. Regardless, here is the sequence:

> throw -> swap places -> retract -> throw -> swap

There's a bit of an ongoing joke between myself and [Marty Wong](http://www.martincwong.com/). He and I have worked together at quite a few game jams, and so, whenever we need a name for our games I'll just ask him and take the first thing he says. "Who Put That Cactus There?" and [Super Block Plane Hyper K2 Turbo](/experimental/superblockplane) are both fruits of this joke.
