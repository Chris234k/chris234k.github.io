A Twitch streamer [Day 9](https://www.twitch.tv/day9tv) was hosting a 30 day monthly project. The idea was you'd share your progress on his website, and then everyone else could see what you were working on. It gave a pretty decent senese of community and progress. I chose to make Breakout in SDL, which you can see the entire process of [here!](https://dk30.day9.tv/projects/143407810544271360-1541895648581?t=1542169462242). I was primarily interested in brushing up on some C++ stuff because it'd been a few years since I'd done anything significant with it.
