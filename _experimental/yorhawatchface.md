I absolutely adore [Nier:Automata](http://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/). The [UI style](https://www.platinumgames.com/official-blog/article/9624) is very clean and I thought it would look great on my watch. I created this watch face as both an exploration into Android development, and a means to celebrate Nier. You've probably noticed some similarities between the design of this website and Nier's UI as well. The watch face is a bit rough: there is a bit of delay when the animation begins, and performance when switching to other menus is a bit jittery. Never released publicly, partially due to these reasons.
