# About
Hey! I'm Chris Bruno.

I'm a game programmer, but you'll also find me at the intersection of code and design. Most of my time is spent programming with C# in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). Games have always been something special to me, and I've been fortunate enough to pursue a career in them. I've been making video games (or trying!) since college in 2011 and working in industry since 2015.

If you'd like to chat about games, development or otherwise-- the best way to get in contact with me is through email: [chris234k@gmail.com](mailto:chris234k@gmail.com)
