# About
Hey! I'm Chris Bruno.

</div>

I'm a game developer who works full time at [Petricore](http://www.petricoregames.com). Most of my time at work is spent programming with C# in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). The thing I enjoy most about programming is problem solving. I love digging in and really trying to understand how it all works. Though it's different from what I typically do day-to-day, I have a personal interest in tools and engine development. The unifying idea between the two is: understanding how people work.

### Skills
* Fluent: C#
* Some experience: C++, HTML, Objective-C, Java
* Unity 4, 5, 2017
* Git, Perforce, SVN
* XCode, Android Studio

### Petricore
Petricore was created by myself and few friends immediately following graduation from [Becker College](https://www.becker.edu/) in May 2015. The company is rooted in game development, but we have done a considerable amount of software development as well. What started as a few contracts for apps or museum interactives quickly became the primary source of income for us. We've worked with clients on something like 30 projects. I've personally had a hand in many of these, some of which you'll find in the ["Interactives"](/index.html) section of the main page (yes, I know, it's pretty empty right now). If you'd like to know more about Petricore, please check out our [website](http://petricoregames.com/).

### Hobbies
If you're still reading this, you're pretty interested in who I am. So here's what I do in my free time:
* Games! (surprise) -- I particularly enjoy games where the interplay between systems is the meat of the game: Super Smash Bros. Melee, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Celeste, Opus Magnum, etc. Allowing players to express themselves within sophisticated mechanics is my jam.
* Running -- I'm not very fast (pb: 27:01 5K), but there's a certain clarity and freedom that comes with a 6 a.m. run.
* Programming (double surprise) -- This website was born of my interest in HTML. I've also done a bit of [Android Wear development](/experimental/yorhawatchface) and a pinch of [OpenGL](https://twitter.com/ruhrohbruno/status/947873534197551106)
* Guitar -- It's been some years since I've seriously practiced guitar, but once and a while I find myself picking it up to play.
